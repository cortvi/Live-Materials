To make a GameObject use a Live Material you just need to add the component "Live Material",
inside the category "marsh", and set up the textures and materials using the user-friendly custom editor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a brief explanation about some elements of the custom editor:

	> Affect GI — if realtime GI is enabled and object is static, enabling this will make
		      the changes affect the lighting.

	> Material debugging — Prints warnings whenever something goes wrong. This should be enabled
			       in case you're having trouble.

	> Extense debugging — This will only show up if 'Material debugging' is enabled. Prints
			      not only warnings but also overall information about what's going on.
			      This will saturate your console, so it should only be enabled if you
			      don't have a clue about what's failing.

	> Looping — If enabled, material animations won't stop looping unless you do it manually.

	> Play on awake — If enabled, all textures will start it's animation as soon as the game's started.

	> Update when offscreen — If enabled, materials will play always even when camera is not rendering the object.
				  If you have quite a few Live Materials, disabling this may help improve performance,
				  but may also cause unexpected results, especially with materials affecting GI.

	> Play backwards — Pretty self-explanatory.

	> Fallback texture — When a texture has no animation loaded ( or it has been cleared through code ) Fallback texture
			     will remain. This is useful if you are loading the animations at runtime.
