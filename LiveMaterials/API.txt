Here are all the public non-static functions to control
the animations on your Live Materials.

*Avoiding the use of this API and making direct changes may cause the code to break*
*If this happens, just delete the script and replace it with a new one*


	> Play ( params int[] index ) — starts playing all texture animations on given materials.
		.index — All the index of the materials you want to start playing.
			 If none index is given, all materials will start playing.



	> Pause ( params int[] index ) — pauses all texture animations on given materials.
		.index — All the index of the materials you want to pause.
			 If none index is given, all materials will pause.



	> Stop ( params int[] index ) — same as 'Pause' but it also resets the animation.



	> SetFPS ( float fps, int matID, params int[] txID ) — sets the framerate for the given animation
		.fps — the framerate to assing.
		.matID — The material ID as shown in the inspector.
		.txID — All thhe textures ID as shown in the inspector.
			If none ID is given all textures within the material will change their framerate.



	> GoFrame ( int frame, int matID, params int[] txID ) — jumps into the given frame
		.frame — the frame to jump into.
		.matID — The material ID as shown in the inspector.
		.txID — All the texture ID as shown in the inspector.
			If none ID is given all textures within the material will jump into given frame.



	> LoadAnimation ( Texture2D[] animation, int matID, int txID ) — Loads an animation into a material texture.
		.animation — The array of Texture2D to be loaded as the frames of the animation.
		.matID — The material ID as shown in the inspector.
		.txID — The texture ID as shown in the inspector.



	> ClearTexture ( int matID, int txID ) — Deletes the animation stored in the given texture.
		.matID — The material ID as shown in the inspector.
		.txID — The texture ID as shown in the inspector.
		*NOTE: cleaning the animation will cause the texture fallback to show up.



	> SetTextureState ( bool enabled, int matID, int txID ) — Sets the state ( enabled / disabled ) of a texture.
		*NOTE: Disabling a texture will keep its animation and show up fallback texture. 
		       If you enable a texture it will play if its material is already playing.
		.enabled — Whether to enable or disable the texture.
		.matID — The material ID as shown in the inspector.
		.txID — The texture ID as shown in the inspector.



	> ConfigMaterial ( int matID, bool loop, bool playOnAwake, bool offscreenUpdate, bool backwards ) — Sets the global properties of a Live Material.
		.matID — The material ID as shown in the inspector.
		.loop — Whether the animation keeps looping.
		.playOnAwake — Whether the material starts playing when GameObject is created.
		.offscreenUpdate — Whether the material keeps playing when offscreen.
		.backwards — Whether material animations play backwards.


	> IsPlaying ( int matID ) — check if given material is currently playing.
		.matID — The material ID as shown in the inspector.
