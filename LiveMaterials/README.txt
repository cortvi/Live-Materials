Unity Asset provided by @marsh12th
now freely shared on GitHub.

I used this in my projects as a way to avoid using Movie Textures and
also because Live Materials can interact with the Unity GI.

This is tested on Unity 5.0.0, should work on later versions too,
not tested on all though.

Here is a few guidelines in order to use this asset propperly.

You are free to edit any script, but please notice that several lines
are commented out for the sake of Work In Progress Features or testing.
If you wish to decomment them realise that all the code will probbably crash.

Note that the code has a few public memembers but you SHOULD NOT modify ANY of them
and actually ONLY use the API given in the file 'API.txt' since direct changes
may cause problems or break the whole thing.

That said, feel free to improve my code and/or fork the repo if you want to.

Don't hesitate to inform me via Twitter / mail / GitHub.

Any feedback would be really apreciated!
