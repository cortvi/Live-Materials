# Live Materials
My alternative to Unity movie textures before Unity 5.6

It allows materials to play through a user defined array of textures in order to play a GIF or video on the surface of the material on any of its texture slots.

Also interacts with the Unity GI system if you're modifying the Emissive texture.

Here's an old [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS0Es34NoaY) to show off these features:

With the release of Unity 5.6 they included the new video player so I guess this makes my asset quite deprecated so I'm just sharing it here in case anyone finds it useful.

# License
You are free to do whatever you want with this:  
download, fork, commercial and non-commercial use, etc...  
As long as you credit me as the MIT License stands.

# Use
Just clone the **LiveMaterials** folder wherever in your Unity project and read the files inside it.

# To-Do
Optimization: Use the new TextureArray shader feature.
